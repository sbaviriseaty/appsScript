# appsScript
 
 Conglomeration of all my Google Apps Scripts to date. All of them were made for a student organization I am involved with. I really enjoy building solutions like these that enhance productivity. I've learned a lot about Javascript, the Google Workspace, and general workflow building in the process. I would love to take upon any new opportunity in which I can once again apply these skills. 

 The code is currently organized by which club they pertain to: UFSO (University of Florida Science Olympiad) or URSP (University Research Scholars Program - Student Advisory Board). Within these root directories, the code is then subsequently split into their relevant project folders. To date, I have written code for eight different projects, and I self-taught myself Javascript so I could work on these.
