# appsScript
 
 Conglomeration of all my Google Apps Scripts to date. All of them were made for a student organization I am involved with. I really enjoy building solutions like these that enhance productivity. I've learned a lot about Javascript, the Google Workspace, and general workflow building in the process. I would love to take upon any new opportunity in which I can once again apply these skills.
